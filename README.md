I’ve been using different LLMs, and while they’re great, none of them are exactly what I want. Eventually, Apple and Samsung will probably create their version of "Her," but until then, here’s my attempt.

The main goal of this project is to create a personal assistant that:

- Is aware of my daily life and tasks
- Assists me with my tasks using tools
- integrates with my github and automatiates my work proess with one single command from ideation to deployment
- automataes my process of jotting down my ideas with notion
- jotting down 

I’m starting by building a Notion and Calander integration in voice mode, enabling LLMs to access memory and reference previous conversations. This is just the first step toward crafting a truly personal AI assistant.
